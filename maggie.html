                <div>
                    <p> This is my dog Maggie. She is a Border Collie hybrid.
                        To be exact, her mother is a pure breed Border Collie and her father is a Labrador/Bernese
                        Mountain Dog Hybrid.
                        Her mother Lara, lives with my aunty in the countryside where she keeps track of the horses,
                        sheep and chickens.
                        Back in 2009, my aunty noticed that Lara put on a lot of weight and got really fat-looking.
                        At first she thought her husband gave the dog too much food and she immediately stopped giving
                        her the normal amount of food.
                        The problem was, my auntie's husband had the same thought and also didn't gave Lara as much to
                        eat. However, Lara grew a bigger belly and then they realized that she must be pregnant.
                        My aunty and uncle had wanted to wait for Lara's spaying until after her first heat. But Lara's
                        heat wasn't as noticeable as the other dogs' had been.
                        And so it was clear, cute little fur balls were going to run around soon.</p>


                    <h4>Welcome to the world</h4>
                    <p> On the 26th May 2009, eight little pups were born! I promised my mother that we would only drive
                        to my aunty to take a look at the pups. But it was so hard for me to resist.
                        I always wanted to own a dog, and especially a Border Collie! And so I started begging and being
                        annoying every day, until the whole family said yes!</p>

                    <p> Then the finally the day arrived to choose my puppy. It wasn't easy, I can tell you! My aunty
                        brought them outside and put them in a little pen so I could view them better all at once.
                        They were jumpy and playful like puppies should be. But one of them did not. This one little
                        puppy walked straight towards me.
                        The only thing between us was the little wood fence and the pup looked up to me without turning
                        a blind eye. And than I knew, that she was gonna be my new best friend!</p>

                    <h4>The day I almost lost her</h4>
                    <p> Before she was nearly a year old, something terrible happened to her. She already got her food,
                        and normally we do not let her out afterwards,
                        but my mother though she still needed to go to the bathroom and she let her out, because she was
                        acting really nervous.
                        When my mum let her out, she ran like lightning to the end of our yard next to the street, and
                        started barking very aggressively.
                        Right afterward, she stopped. She came back inside and everything seemed fine at first. But
                        then, her whole body started shaking and she started panting a lot.
                        My mother immediately called the vet in our town. This stupid woman said, that she had no time
                        now, we should just cover her with a blanket. Than my mother called our vet we used to use,
                        but it is many kilometres away from us. He was so nice, and kept his clinic open for us. When we
                        finally arrived at the vet, Maggie walked into the vet with all her last bit of energy to walk
                        and she collapsed.
                        The vet told us that she had been poisoned with rat poison/ Days later we heard that Maggie was
                        the only survivor from this dog hater's attack.</p>

                    <p>Since then, Maggie has had a weak heart. She has a heart like a old dog would have.
                        She sadly can't play as much as other dogs and she has to make many pauses because she gets
                        easily exhausted.
                        But with her medicine she can do much more.</p>
<details>
    <summary>A littel bit more</summary>
                    <p> Maggie is a wonderful loving dog, who sees everyone as a friend to play with. She is very
                        protective over me, but gets easily scared of loud noises.
                        She can be very stubborn: if she doesn't want something and if she still has to do it she let
                        you know that she is not amused by making some weird oink noises.
                        Her favourite position to lie is on her back and also while chewing on her toys. Her favourite
                        games are football and disc dog. Her favourite stuffed animal is a tiny Tiger called Leo, which
                        she has since 2009.
                        A two-hour walk is the minimum for her! And if I don't know where to go, I walk to the school
                        and visit the afternoon care kids.
                        Besides this, she love to ride in the car, bus and the tram at high speed. Low speed seems to be
                        boring to her (she starts whining and oinky noises).
                        She also enjoys swimming in the ponds high up in the mountains where she can run unleashed.
                        Her best friends are DJ (a friend's Terrier mix) and my auntie's Malinois, Luna. Beside this,
                        she has two baby rabbits she takes care of all day long.</p>
